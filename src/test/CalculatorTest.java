Here are some test cases for the Calculator class:

**Test Case 1: Simple Addition**

* Input: `Calculator.add(2, 3)`
* Expected Output: `5`
* Reasoning: This is a basic addition operation that should work as expected.

**Test Case 2: Simple Subtraction**

* Input: `Calculator.subtract(4, 2)`
* Expected Output: `2`
* Reasoning: Another basic arithmetic operation that should work as expected.

**Test Case 3: Simple Multiplication**

* Input: `Calculator.multiply(5, 6)`
* Expected Output: `30`
* Reasoning: This is a basic multiplication operation that should work as expected.

**Test Case 4: Division by Zero (Expected Exception)**

* Input: `Calculator.divide(10, 0)`
* Expected Exception: `ArithmeticException("Cannot divide by zero")`
* Reasoning: The code specifically checks for division by zero and throws an exception. We're testing this scenario to ensure the correct behavior.

**Test Case 5: Positive Division**

* Input: `Calculator.divide(12, 3)`
* Expected Output: `4`
* Reasoning: This is a positive division operation that should work as expected.

**Test Case 6: Negative Division**

* Input: `Calculator.divide(-10, 2)`
* Expected Output: `-5`
* Reasoning: We're testing the case where one of the inputs is negative. The result should be negative as well.

**Test Case 7: Large Numbers (Overflow)**

* Input: `Calculator.add(Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE)` or similar
* Expected Exception: `ArithmeticException("Result too large")`
* Reasoning: Java has limits on integer values. We're testing the case where the result would exceed these limits, expecting an exception.

These test cases should cover some of the basic scenarios and edge cases for the Calculator class.
