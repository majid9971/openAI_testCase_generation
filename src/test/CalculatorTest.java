Here are some test cases for the `Calculator` class:

**Test Case 1: Adding two positive integers**
* Input: `add(2, 3)`
* Expected Output: `5`
* Test Result: Pass

**Test Case 2: Subtracting a larger number from a smaller number**
* Input: `subtract(5, 2)`
* Expected Output: `3`
* Test Result: Pass

**Test Case 3: Multiplying two positive integers**
* Input: `multiply(4, 5)`
* Expected Output: `20`
* Test Result: Pass

**Test Case 4: Dividing a number by zero (expected to throw ArithmeticException)**
* Input: `divide(10, 0)`
* Expected Exception: `ArithmeticException("Cannot divide by zero")`
* Test Result: Pass

**Test Case 5: Adding two negative integers**
* Input: `add(-2, -3)`
* Expected Output: `-5`
* Test Result: Pass

**Test Case 6: Subtracting a smaller number from a larger negative integer**
* Input: `subtract(-5, -2)`
* Expected Output: `-3`
* Test Result: Pass

**Test Case 7: Multiplying two negative integers**
* Input: `multiply(-4, -5)`
* Expected Output: `20`
* Test Result: Pass

**Test Case 8: Dividing a positive number by a non-zero integer**
* Input: `divide(10, 2)`
* Expected Output: `5`
* Test Result: Pass

These test cases cover various scenarios to ensure that the `Calculator` class is working correctly. Note that you may want to add more test cases depending on your specific requirements and testing goals.
